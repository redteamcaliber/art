# Ronin Art

The Ronin Art repository is meant to preserve any original art-work created
for the Ronin project, so that it can be shared and re-used by future
Ronin projects.

## Prefered Formats

Please save any images in their original format, such as `.psd` used by
[Adobe PhotoShop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/family/) or
`.xcf` used by [The GIMP](http://www.gimp.org/).

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are extremely useful and are appreciated.
